# **App Name**: WAEC Insights

## Core Features:

- Data Visualization: Interactive charts to display WAEC performance trends based on gender, school type, and year, using Recharts.
- Predictive Modeling: A form to collect input parameters and send them to a Python backend to predict future WAEC pass rates, displaying the results in real-time.
- AI-Powered Data Chat: An AI chat interface where users can ask questions about the WAEC data, receiving context-aware responses powered by an LLM tool.
- Sidebar Navigation: A persistent sidebar for easy navigation between the Dashboard, Predictor, and Data Chat features.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) to convey trust, intelligence, and authority.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), almost white, to keep a light, uncluttered feel.
- Accent color: Teal (#2DD4BF) for interactive elements and highlights, providing a fresh and modern touch.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for its modern and neutral appearance, lending itself well to data visualization and user interfaces.
- Lucide React icons for a clean, consistent, and modern look throughout the application.
- Use Shadcn UI's `Card` components for structured content display and a consistent, visually appealing layout.
- Subtle animations, such as loading spinners, to enhance the user experience and provide feedback during data processing.
